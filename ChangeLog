Changes between 0.5 and 0.4:
- optionally color lines by speed
- support for gzipped gps streams
- join node to nearest way function
- merge newly-downloaded data with existing data
- statistics window with speed, maxspeed and total
  distance,
- split ways at selected node
- save format selection: GPX/NMEA
- save changes as OSMChange file
- API0.6 compability
- upload support
- GPS settings and OSM account settings are saved

Changes between 0.4 and 0.3.2:
- inserting POIs 
- configurable tag presets gui for ways and POIs

- do not overwrite old tiles with new zero-sized files
  do not overwrite tile files if size is less than 1/3 of original
- limit number of concurrently running downloads
- trying to download every tile before printing
- also the get_maprect tool downloads its data now
- non-live editing mode: selecting objects, moving nodes,
  deleting objects, adding new ways
- optionally show non-street ways (areas, railways, ...)
- simple map selection dialog if no map is found
 

Changes between 0.3.2 and 0.3.1:
- send r+ to gpsd if no NMEA data arrives
- adding cyclemap wrapper
- fixed handling of alpha channel in pngs so that the cyclemap
  can be displayed
- mouse gestures for route editing no it can be done
  with one mouse button
- manpages


Changes between 0.3 and 0.3.1:
